## An Overview of WAI

The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) aims to assist people 
with dissabilities to access content on the World Wide Web. It
was started by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1997.

### The Benifits of WAI

WAI is designed to assist people with disabilties to access
the web. Disabilities that WAI can assist with include:

* People without eyesite
* People with poor motor skills which makes using a mouse 
  difficult. This includes old people, young people or people
  with shaky hands.
* People that cannot hear
* People that have low internet bandwidth

WAI can also assist people without dissablities. A WAI 
compliant site provides flexability for how users 
view/interact with the site. This means that someone who does
not want to wait for images to download can turn of images; 
or someone who lost their mouse can use a keyboard.

WAI further improves the rating of a site with search engines.
For example, by settings the images on a site to be optional
or providing transcripts for videos, a search engine bot can 
better understand the content on the site.

### WAI guidelines

There are many accessability guidelines for implimenting a
good site. Here are the main ones:

#### Provide text alternatives for non-text content
* For images, provide an "alt" atribute with a good 
  description of what the image is. When the image is purely
  for decorative purposes, set the alt attribute to an empty
  string
* CAPTCHAs should have text based alternatives
* For video/audio should provide a transcript.

#### Content should be distingushable
* Make foreground and background elements easilly 
  distinguable
* Use constrasting colors
  
#### Make content controls usable to all users
* All content should be accessable with a keyboard
* Touchscreens cannot hover - do not have hovering required

#### Site structure should be programatically determinable
* Using HTML5 semantic elements are an easy way to impliment
  this
